All in one typography tool. I think all the necessary files are here if not I apologize at the time of this I wasn't used to tsx files or ts files etc etc. But this isn't my original idea this is from another repo and I just extended the use case with better viewing, more options, tool tips and some other small things. Feel free to use it fork it remake it or whatever!
